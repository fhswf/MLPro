# MLPro - A Synoptic Framework for Standardized Machine Learning Tasks in Python

MLPro provides complete, standardized, and reusable functionalities to support your scientific research, educational tasks or industrial projects in machine learning.

## Key Features

#### a) Open, modular and extensible architecture
- Overarching software infrastructure (mathematics, data management and plotting, UI framework, logging, ...)
- Fundamental ML classes for adaptive models and their training and hyperparameter tuning

#### b) MLPro-RL: Sub-Package for Reinforcement Learning
- Powerful Environment templates for simulation, training and real operation
- Templates for single-agents, model-based agents (MBRL) with action planning to multi-agents (MARL)
- Advanced training/tuning funktionalities with separate evaluation and progress detection
- Growing pool of reuseable environments of automation and robotics

#### c) MLPro-GT: Sub-Package for Cooperative Game Theory
- Templates for (potential based) game boards
- Templates for cooperative multi-players
- Reuse of advanced training/tuning classes and multi-agent environments of sub-package MLPro-RL

#### d) Numerous executable self study examples

#### e) Integration of established 3rd party packages
MLPro provides wrapper classes for:
- Environments of OpenAI Gym and PettingZoo
- Policy Algorithms of Stable Baselines 3
- Hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt


## Documentation
The Documentation is available here: [https://mlpro.readthedocs.io/](https://mlpro.readthedocs.io/)


## Development
- Consequent object-oriented design and programming (OOD/OOP)
- Quality assurance by test-driven development
- Hosted and managed on GitHub
- Agile CI/CD approach with automated test and deployment
- Clean code paradigma


## Project and Team
Project MLPro was started in 2021 by the [Group for Automation Technology and Learning Systems at the South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Germany](https://www.fh-swf.de/de/forschung___transfer_4/labore_3/labs/labor_fuer_automatisierungstechnik__soest_1/standardseite_57.php).

MLPro is currently designed and developed by [Detlef Arend](https://github.com/detlefarend), [M Rizky Diprasetya](https://github.com/rizkydiprasetya), [Steve Yuwono](https://github.com/steveyuwono) and further [contributors](https://github.com/fhswf/MLPro/graphs/contributors).
