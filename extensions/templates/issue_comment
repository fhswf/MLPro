{admins}: 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, 

thank you for wanting to contribute to the MLPro extension hub with your repository [{repo}]({url}). We subject the extension to a short plausibility check and then release it for the extension hub. We will keep you updated on this in this issue. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact us here at any time in the chat. 

If you do not want your repository to be listed in the MLPro extension hub, please let us know as soon as possible and remove the _mlpro-extension_ topic. If you just want to delay the entry to the extension hub, please also contact us. In this case, we will blacklist your repository until you tell us to whitelist it.

Kind regards,
Your MLPro Team
