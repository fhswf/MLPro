## Preparation

### 1. Install Python
First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Jupyter Notebooks run on Python, so this is a prerequisite.
- Windows: Download and install Python from python.org.
- macOS: Python 2.7 is pre-installed, but it's recommended to install the latest version of Python 3.
- Linux: Python usually comes pre-installed, but you can use your package manager to install the latest version.

### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook
You can install Jupyter Notebook using Python's package manager, pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command: <br>
&emsp;<code>pip install notebook</code>

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can launch it by running: <br>
&emsp;<code>jupyter notebook</code><br>
This command will start a local server and open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser.
