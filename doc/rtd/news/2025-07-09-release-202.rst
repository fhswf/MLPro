MLPro 2.0.2 released
=====================

Version 2.0.2 of MLPro has been released. While this update is formally classified as a bugfix release, it includes significant architectural revisions aimed at improving the consistency and robustness of scaling and normalization processes across both online and batch learning workflows.

Key changes in version 2.0.2:
-----------------------------

**MLPro-OA-Streams:**

- Comprehensive redesign and integration of the scaler and normalizer system to ensure a unified handling of data preprocessing in all scenarios.
- Performance optimizations targeting the real-time visualization of streaming data scenarios.
- Ready-to-run stream tasks for **auto-renormalization** in stream workflows, based on z-transformation or min-max 

This release focuses on consolidating core functionality and improving the foundation for future developments. By resolving architectural inconsistencies and enhancing performance, version 2.0.2 provides a more stable and predictable base for upcoming features.
