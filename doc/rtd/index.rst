MLPro - Machine Learning Professional
================================================

Welcome to MLPro - the synoptic framework for standardized machine learning tasks in Python!

MLPro provides complete, standardized and reusable functionalities to support your scientific research, 
industrial projects or educational tasks in machine learning.

The documentation is currently under construction, but we are working flat out to complete it. The framework 
itself is ready for use and we are proud to offer you extensive functionalities, especially in the area of 
reinforcement learning and game theory. A number of self-study examples are available in Appendix 1 and 
the API documentation in Appendix 2 is pretty complete. Try it out and get in touch with any questions or problems. 
Have fun!
