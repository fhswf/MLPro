3rd Party Support
=================

As part of the MLPro project, numerous public data providers have been and are being integrated. 
Their data sets are mapped to MLPro's stream concept using wrapper technology and can, therefore, 
be easily consumed in your own ML applications.

Examples to be mentioned here are:

   - `MLPro-Int-OpenML - Integration of OpenML into MLPro <https://mlpro-int-openml.readthedocs.io>`_
   - `MLPro-Int-scikit-learn - Integration of scikit-learn into MLPro <https://mlpro-int-scikit-learn.readthedocs.io>`_
   - `MLPro-Int-River - Integration of River into MLPro <https://mlpro-int-river.readthedocs.io>`_

A complete list of all approved MLPro extensions can be found in the :ref:`MLPro Extension Hub <target_extension_hub>`.
