.. _target_oa_streams:
Online-adaptive data stream processing (OADSP)
==============================================

This sub-framework of MLPro-OA is directly related to the research topic of online machine learning (OML). It deals with
online-adaptive stream tasks embedded in a stream workflow as part of an extended process model. This process model extends
the non-adaptive DSP process model of sub-framework MLPro-BF-Streams by advanced adaptation mechanisms like 

   - Event-oriented adaptation
   - Cascaded adaptation
   - Reverse adaptation

which are explained in more detail below.

The description is still under contruction but parts of the sub-menu and first howtos and API specifications are already available.
Browse the menu and see Section 'Cross reference' for further details.
