- **Policy Creation**

    .. image:: images/MLPro-RL-Agent_Class_Policy_Commented.png
    
    Creating a custom RL policy that satisfies the MLPro interface is straightforward.
    First of all, the users need to inherit a base Policy class.
    Then, the users can develop their custom policies by fulfilling at least 2 main functions, namely **compute_action** and **_adapt**, as shown in the following code.
    The compute action method (**compute_action**) is a function to calculate an action in the current state.
    Meanwhile, the adapt method (**_adapt**) is a function to optimize the policy according to past experience. 

    .. code-block:: python
    
        from mlpro.rl.models import *
        
        class MyPolicy (Policy):
            """
            Creates a policy that satisfies mlpro interface.
            """

            C_NAME      = 'MyPolicy'
        
            def compute_action(self, p_state: State) -> Action:
                """
                Specific action computation method to be redefined. 
        
                Parameters:
                    p_state       State of environment
        
                Returns:
                    Action object
                """
                ....
        
        
            def _adapt(self, *p_args) -> bool:
                """
                Adapts the policy based on State-Action-Reward (SAR) data that will be expected as a SAR
                buffer object. Please call super-method at the beginning of your own implementation and
                adapt only if it returns True.
        
                Parameters:
                    p_arg[0]            SAR Buffer object
                """
        
                if not super().adapt(*p_args): return False
                
                ....
                return True
                
    
    Hyperparameters of the policy should be stored in the internal object **self._hp_list**, so that they can be tuned from outside.
    The hyperparameter initialization method (**_init_hyperparam**) can be used in this case.
    To set up a hyperparameter space, please refer to our :ref:`how-to file <Howto BF ML 001>`.

- **Policy from Third Party Packages**

    Alternatively, the user can also apply algorithms from Stable Baselines 3 by using the developed relevant wrapper for the integration between third-party packages and MLPro.
    For more information, please click :ref:`here<target_extension_hub>`.

- **Algorithm Checker**

    A test script using a unit test to check the developed policies will be available soon!
