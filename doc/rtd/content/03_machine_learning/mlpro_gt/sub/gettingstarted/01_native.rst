MLPro-GT-Native
-------------------

Here is a concise series to introduce all users to the MLPro-GT-Native in a practical way, whether you are a first-timer or an experienced MLPro user.

If you are a first-timer, then you can begin with **Section (1) What is MLPro?**.

If you have understood MLPro but not the game theoretical approach, then you can jump to **Section (2) What is Game Theory?**.

If you have experience in both MLPro and game theory, then you can directly start with **Section (3) What is MLPro-GT?**.

After following the below step-by-step guideline, we expect the user understands the MLPro-GT in practice and starts using MLPro-GT-Native.

**1. What is MLPro?**
   If you are a first-time user of MLPro, you might wonder what is MLPro.
   Therefore, we recommend initially starting with understanding MLPro by checking out the following steps:

   (a) :ref:`MLPro: An Introduction <target_mlpro_introduction>`

   (b) `introduction video of MLPro <https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2665963822001051-mmc1.mp4>`_

   (c) :ref:`installing and getting started with MLPro <target_mlpro_getstarted>`

   (d) `MLPro paper in Software Impact journal <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2022.100421>`_

**2. What is Game Theory?**
   Game theory is a branch of mathematics and social science that examines strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.
   It involves modeling scenarios where individuals or entities, referred to as players, make decisions that influence one another.
   Players choose from a set of strategies, and the resulting outcomes, or payoffs, are determined by the collective decisions.
   The concept of Nash equilibrium, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy, is central to game theory.
   This framework is widely applied across disciplines such as economics, engineering, political science, and biology, offering insights into strategic decision-making, predicting outcomes, and formulating optimal strategies in interactive situations.

**3. What is MLPro-GT?**
   We expect that you have a basic knowledge of MLPro and game theory.
   Therefore, you need to understand the overview of MLPro-GT by following the steps below:

   (a) :ref:`MLPro-GT introduction page <target_overview_GT>`

   (b) `Section 5 of MLPro 1.0 paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mlwa.2022.100341>`_
