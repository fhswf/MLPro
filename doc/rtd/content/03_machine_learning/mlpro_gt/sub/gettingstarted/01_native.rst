No experience with MLPro? To learn more about MLPro, please refer to the :ref:`Getting Started page of MLPro <target_mlpro_getstarted>`.

By following the step-by-step guidelines below, we expect you to gain a practical understanding of MLPro-GT and begin using MLPro-GT-Native.

**1. What is Game Theory?**
   Game theory is a branch of mathematics and social science that examines strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.
   It involves modeling scenarios where individuals or entities, referred to as players, make decisions that influence one another.
   Players choose from a set of strategies, and the resulting outcomes, or payoffs, are determined by the collective decisions.
   The concept of Nash equilibrium, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy, is central to game theory.
   This framework is widely applied across disciplines such as economics, engineering, political science, and biology, offering insights into strategic decision-making, predicting outcomes, and formulating optimal strategies in interactive situations.
