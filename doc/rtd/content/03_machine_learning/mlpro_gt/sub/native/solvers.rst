Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of game theory, solvers refer to computational tools or algorithms designed to find solutions to games.
These solutions can include Nash equilibria, strategies, or other relevant outcomes that help analyze and understand the strategic interactions between players.
Game theory solvers are particularly useful for complex games where manual analysis may be impractical or time-consuming.
There are different types of solvers in game theory, depending on the nature of the game and the specific problem being addressed.

In MLPro-GT-Native, there are two possibilities to utilize a solver, either create a custom solver or reuse a solver from pool of solvers, as follows:

      :maxdepth: 1

      solvers/pool
