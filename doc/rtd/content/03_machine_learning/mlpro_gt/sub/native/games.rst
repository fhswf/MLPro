Games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A "game" refers to a formalized model of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers, known as players.
These players can be individuals, companies, countries, or any entities capable of making decisions.
Games in game theory are designed to analyze situations where the outcome for each player depends not only on their own actions but also on the actions of others.
Key components of a game in game theory include players, strategies, payoffs, and more.

Games can be classified into various types based on different criteria, such as the number of players, the information available to players, the timing of moves, and the degree of cooperation among players.
Common types of games include simultaneous games, sequential games, cooperative games, non-cooperative games, and more.
The objective of game theory is to analyze and predict the strategic interactions and outcomes in these games, providing insights into decision-making, cooperation, competition, and rational behavior in a wide range of fields.
