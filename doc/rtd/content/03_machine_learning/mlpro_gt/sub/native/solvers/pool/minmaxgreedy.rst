Min-Max Greedy Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
**General Information**

In game theory, the minimum and maximum greedy policy is a decision-making strategy used by players to optimize their outcomes in zero-sum or even general-sum games.
Zero-sum games are situations where one player's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of other players, while general-sum games are the opposite.
The term "greedy" refers to the strategy of maximizing one's own payoff while minimizing the potential payoff of the opponent.

The maximum greedy can be imported via:

.. code-block:: python

    from mlpro.gt.pool.native.solvers.greedypolicy import MaxGreedyPolicy

The minimum greedy can be imported via:

.. code-block:: python

    from mlpro.gt.pool.native.solvers.greedypolicy import MinGreedyPolicy
