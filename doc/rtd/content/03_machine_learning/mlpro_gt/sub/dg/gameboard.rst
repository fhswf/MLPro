Game Boards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A game board is a "place" where players perform and interact to each other in game theory.
There are three main possibilities to set up a game board in MLPro-GT-DG, such as:

   (1) the user can develop a custom game board,

   (2) the user can reuse available RL Environments from MLPro, OpenAI Gym, or PettingZoo, and

   (3) the user can reuse the provided game boards by accessing them from the pool of objects.
