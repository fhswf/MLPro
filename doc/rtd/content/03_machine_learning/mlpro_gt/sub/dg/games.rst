Games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Game theory encompasses various types of games, each with its unique characteristics and applications.
Potential games, for example, are characterized by the existence of a potential function that simplifies the analysis of equilibrium strategies.
In these games, players' best responses collectively minimize a global cost or potential.

Congestion games involve players choosing strategies in a shared environment where the payoff for each player depends on the congestion or competition for resources.
Traffic networks and communication systems often serve as examples of congestion games.

Stackelberg games are a type of sequential game where one player, known as the leader, makes decisions first, and the other player, the follower, observes those decisions before making their own.
This model is often applied in economic and business contexts, such as pricing and quantity decisions in a supply chain.

Other types of games include cooperative games where players form coalitions to achieve joint objectives and non-cooperative games like the prisoner's dilemma, where self-interest guides decision-making.
Evolutionary games explore strategic interactions with a focus on the long-term evolution of strategies within a population.

Overall, the diversity of game types within game theory allows for a rich understanding of strategic behavior in various domains, providing valuable insights for decision-makers and analysts.

In the actual MLPro-GT-DG, we provide standardized template modules for two type of games, such as:

   (1) Potential Games

   (2) Stackelberg Games
