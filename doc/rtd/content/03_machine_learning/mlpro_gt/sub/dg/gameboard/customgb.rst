- **Game Board Creation for Simulation Mode**

    Creating a game board that satisfies the MLPro interface is immensely simple and straightforward.
    Basically, an MLPro game board is a class with several main functions. Each game board must apply the
    following MLPro functions:
    
    .. code-block:: python
        
        from mlpro.gt.models import *
        
        class MyGameBoard(GameBoard):
            """

            C_REWARD_TYPE   = Reward.C_TYPE_EVERY_AGENT    # Default reward type

    One of the benefits for MLPro users is the variety of reward structures, which is useful for a multi-player GT approach.
    Three types of reward structures are supported in this framework, such as:
    
    1. **C_TYPE_OVERALL** is the default type and is a scalar overall value,
    
    2. **C_TYPE_EVERY_AGENT** is a scalar for every player, and
    
    3. **C_TYPE_EVERY_ACTION** is a scalar for every player and action.
    
    To set up state- and action spaces using our basic functionalities, please refer to :ref:`Howto GT-002: Train Multi-Player <Howto GT 002>`.

- **Game Board Creation for Real Hardware Mode**

    In MLPro, we can choose simulation mode or real hardware mode. For real hardware mode, the creation of
    an environment is very similar to thesimulation mode. You do not need to define **_simulate_reaction**, but you
    need to replace it with **_export_action** and **_import_state** as it is shown in the following:
    
    .. code-block:: python

        def _export_action(self, p_action: Action) -> bool:
            """
            Mode C_MODE_REAL only: exports given action to be processed externally 
            (for instance by a real hardware). Please redefine. 
        
            Parameters
            ----------
            p_action : Action
                Action to be exported
        
            Returns
            -------
            bool
                True, if action export was successful. False otherwise.
        
            """
        
            raise NotImplementedError
        
        def _import_state(self) -> bool:
            """
            Mode C_MODE_REAL only: imports state from an external system (for instance a real hardware). 
            Please redefine. Please use method set_state() for internal update.
        
            Returns
            -------
            bool
                True, if state import was successful. False otherwise.
        
            """
        
            raise NotImplementedError

- **Game Board Checker**

    To check whether your developed game board is compatible with the MLPro interface, we provide a test script
    using Unittest. At the moment, you can find the source code `here <https://github.com/fhswf/MLPro/blob/main/test/test_environment.py>`_.
    We will prepare a built-in testing module in MLPro, show you how to execute the testing soon and provides an example as well.
