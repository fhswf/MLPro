.. _target_sl_afct_pool_pytorch:
Adaptive Function Pytorch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First of all, it is important to understand the adaptive function in MLPro-SL, which can be found on :ref:`this page <target_bf_sl_afct>`.

In this functionality, we integrate PyTorch into MLPro-SL, thus PyTorch functionalities can be reused in MLPro-SL.

At the moment, we provide only PyTorch-based multilayer perceptron in the pool, but recurrent neural networks and transformers are planned to be included in the next version shortly.
